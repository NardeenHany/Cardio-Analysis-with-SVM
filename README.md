# Cardio-Analysis-with-SVM
Machine Learning Project with SVM
Conducted an analysis of the cardio dataset containing medical data on patients to predict the presence of 
cardiovascular disease using an SVM algorithm.
Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set after conducting hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVM model.
Conducted feature selection and importance analysis to identify the most predictive features for cardiovascular 
disease.
Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning algorithms such as SVM using programming languages such as 
Python.
